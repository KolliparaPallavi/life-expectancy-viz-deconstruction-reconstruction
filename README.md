# Life Expectancy Visualization – Europe 2021
Project Overview
Reconstructed a problematic life expectancy at birth visualization for European countries (2021). The original chart had unclear axes, oversized markers, and background clutter that made insights hard to interpret. Using R and ggplot2, I created a clear, accurate, and insightful visualization.
### Key Highlights
Problem Solving: Identified and fixed 3 main issues – unclear question, deceptive methods, and color/perceptual problems.
Data Cleaning: Processed and validated European life expectancy data to ensure accuracy.
Visualization: Redesigned using clean axes, readable scales, and clear color coding for easy comparison.
Audience Focus: Targeted public health officials, researchers, and the general public for actionable insights.
### Skills Demonstrated
Data critique and deconstruction
Data preprocessing and cleaning in R
Advanced ggplot2 visualization techniques
Narrative storytelling with data
